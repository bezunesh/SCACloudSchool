    <h3>Container Image Immutablity</h3>
    <p>
        Immutable means that a container won't be modified during its life: no updates, no patches, no configuration changes.
        If you must update the application code or apply a patch, you build a new image and redeploy it. 
        Immutability makes deployments safer and more repeatable. If you need to roll back, 
        you simply redeploy the old image. This approach allows you to deploy the same container image in every one of your environments, 
        making them as identical as possible.
